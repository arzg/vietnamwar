*‌Walter Cronkite Reports On Tet Offensive* is a striking image of Walter Cronkite on-site in Vietnam. As it can today be found in the CBS Photo Archive, it is likely that it was taken by CBS News staff. Given the circumstances, it may have been during the filming of *Report From Vietnam.*

The reasons for the photo’s creation are unclear; there are two possibilities. The most likely of these is that it was taken for historical purposes, or perhaps to document Cronkite’s reporting from Vietnam. If this is indeed correct, the target audience of the photograph consists of historians and those who are looking back upon or examining journalism during the Vietnam War. Alternatively, the photo may have been shot in order to promote *Report From Vietnam,* or even CBS News as a whole. In this case, however, the target audience consists of those who CBS News wants to compel to watch *Report From Vietnam,* namely people who do not know about the state of affairs in Vietnam, or those who want to learn more about the Vietnam War.

The source provides a great amount of information about the nature of the Tet Offensive. For example, through the scorched, leafless trees in the background it can be deduced that the area was bombed. Although the exact location of the photo has not been identified, bombing did indeed take place during the Tet Offensive.

This would have been devastating to civilians: for example, in the historical capital of Hue, 17,000 houses stood; after American and South Vietnamese forces had driven out the Viet Cong occupation, only 7,000 houses were left.

Additionally, Cronkite’s wearing of a helmet and some form of thick vest indicate that danger was still present in the area. This corroborates with the possibility that the photo was taken during the filming of *Report From Vietnam,* as in the report gunshots and explosions can be heard throughout.

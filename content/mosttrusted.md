A website, this short source provides a high-level overview of Walter Cronkite’s relationship with the Vietnam War. The source originates from the University of Oregon, and was published on 5 June 2014. Although the source provides a revisionist and opinionated view of the events that occurred before, during and after the publishing of *Report From Vietnam,* it originates from a trustworthy university with no call to action or clear attempt at influencing opinion. It is because of this that the source’s motive is likely for a research project or report. It follows that the audience of the website consists primarily of students and staff members at the university, as well as those interested in Walter Cronkite’s history.

The source lays bare how Cronkite was at first a loyal supporter of the American war effort in Vietnam. However, it then delineates Cronkite’s troubled reaction to the contrast between images he received from Vietnam, and the narrative that President Johnson was promoting. The source goes on to suggest that Cronkite’s status as a defender of objectivity and neutrality was the precise reason for *Report From Vietnam’s* impact:

> On Feburary [sic] 27, 1968, he summed up his trip to Vietnam at the end of his CBS Special Report, Report from Vietnam: Who, What, When, Where, Why? with a rare editorial report. This break of character was such a personal departure, that the nation was stunned at what they heard.

Following this, the website expounds the lasting impact of *Report From Vietnam:* how it affected President Johnson’s decision to not seek a second term, as well as how it made an increase in the United States’ presence in Vietnam ‘no longer thinkable’.

This source consists of the first four minutes of a thirty-minute long television report broadcasted by CBS News on 27 February 1968. It was uploaded in full to YouTube on 19 February 2020 by user btm0815ma. As a part of CBS News’ *Who, What, Where, When, Why* series, *Report From Vietnam* provides an overview of the Vietnam War. It is presented by Walter Cronkite, a CBS news anchor of nineteen years that was known as ‘the most trusted man in America’. The report’s most significant moment is that of when Cronkite states his own opinion that the war will end in stalemate and that the US should negotiate, rather than fight.

The source was created to inform the public in detail about the Vietnam War; as such, the source‘s audience is the general public, especially those who want to learn more about the Vietnam War. Some may oppose this view due to Cronkite’s expression of opinion; however, it is believed that this view is nevertheless valid due to a number of factors:

- Cronkite was well respected for being objective
- He clearly distinguished his opinion from fact
- This is the only significant time Cronkite publicly stated a opinion

*Report From Vietnam* begins with a scene of ruins caused by the Viet Cong’s Tet Offensive attacks, with Cronkite asking the viewer whether they signify ‘success or setback’ for South Vietnamese and American forces, thereby not imparting any opinion. Subsequently, Cronkite interviews a government critic and South Vietnam’s president about the aforementioned question. To remain impartial, Cronkite does not speak during the interviews, instead letting the interviewees speak for themselves. Unfortunately, an interview of someone representing North Vietnamese interests is not included. Although this could be considered a blatant omission, it is vital to remember that this is during a *war*, and as such it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to do so. The part of the report that is being examined as part of this source ends with Cronkite standing amongst ruins in Saigon, explaining how figures of the war’s toll cannot be taken at face value. As Cronkite lists a number of deaths that could not possibly have been included in the figures, the suffering of civilians caused by the Tet Offensive is made evident.

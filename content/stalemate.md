This source is an opinion piece from *The New York Times* that was written by Mark Bowden and published on 26 February 2018. The article is aimed at readers who are interested in the Vietnam War, as well as the reporting of the time. It covers how not only Cronkite, but also other news sources at the time, had a custom of being completely impartial. Bowden then goes on to assert that this very property is what allowed for Cronkite’s statement at the end of *Report From Vietnam* --

> To say that we are closer to victory today is to believe, in the face of the evidence, the optimists who have been wrong in the past. To suggest we are on the edge of defeat is to yield to unreasonable pessimism. To say that were are mired in stalemate seems the only realistic, yet unsatisfactory, conclusion.

-- to be so impactful; readers had amassed trust in him, which he now used to impart an opinion with great weight. It is at this point that the opinion piece begins to stray from neutrality as Bowden declares Cronkite’s statement to be 100% accurate.

Afterwards, Bowden explains how Cronkite had started as a staunch supporter of the Vietnam War, and had always believed the side of the story the American government had provided him with -- that the allied forces were winning. However, once the Tet offensive occurred, the article communicates that Cronkite began to wonder whether this was really the case. It expresses that Cronkite immediately travelled to Vietnam after the attacks, where he was convinced that the war was unwinnable and would inevitably end in stalemate. *When Walter Cronkite Pronounced the War a ‘Stalemate’* implies that it was after this that Cronkite began the production of his *Report From Vietnam* in order to convey to the public the reality of Vietnam he had learned of.

At almost one hour and thirty minutes, this video source is very extensive in its coverage of the Vietnam War; the only part that will be examined here are the first ten minutes. *Vietnam: Chronicle of a War* is a documentary created by CBS News that was released in 1981. It is of an editorial nature; for example, when talking about the Gulf of Tonkin incident, one of Walter Cronkite’s colleagues describes it as ‘fishy’. Another example can be seen in the mentioning of public perception of the war, where American sentiment is reported as if it was wholly against the war, when this was in fact not entirely the case. As such, although the foremost motive for the creation of the documentary was almost certainly education, the possibility of the documentary acting as a way to influence public opinion of the war retroactively cannot be ruled out.

Nevertheless, the audience of the documentary is the general public, especially those that do not know much about the Vietnam War. This is presumably the case due to the level of basic explanation and backstory in the documentary that someone who is vaguely familiar with the war would already know.
